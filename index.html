        It is paramount to acknowledge that Bhasskar stands as a revered member of the Order of the Phoenix within the wizarding community. 
        Within his grasp lies not solely the enigmatic powers binding the elements of the universe but also the elusive and formidable magic of the Phoenix. 
        This magic, both revered for its strength and enigmatic serenity, 
        mirrors Bhasskar's essence, much akin to the cryptic scar etched upon his cheekâ€”a tangible testament to his ethereal connection with the Phoenix, 
        embodying his unrevealed destiny.

                Software Engineer at Optum.
                A seasoned DevOps professional specializing in creating efficient infrastructure with Terraform for AWS and Azure, reducing costs and enhancing deployment speed. 
                My expertise spans CI/CD pipeline setup, leveraging tools like Packer and Azure DevOps, streamlining migrations and improving time-to-market. 
                I've adeptly managed disaster recovery, resolved security vulnerabilities using cutting-edge tools, and even fine-tuned language models for improved code reviews. 
                With a focus on automation and modernization, I've contributed to client-specific features, Kubernetes based migration, and maintained robust automation frameworks like Selenium for product consistency. 
                My role involves managing end-to-end development lifecycles, ensuring quality, and conducting knowledge transfer sessions to automate manual tasks effectively.

                BTech at the Gitam University major in computer science engineering. Engaging lectures, hands-on workshops, and insightful seminars molded my understanding of programming languages, software development, and database management.
                One standout highlight was the Smart Plug Solution IoT project, a hands-on venture that encapsulated the practical application of my learning. 
                This project allowed me to dive into the world of Internet of Things (IoT), implementing innovative solutions while collaborating with peers and faculty mentors.
